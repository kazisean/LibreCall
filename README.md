## ðŸ“š Technical Architecture

LibreCall built on the following technologies to deliver a lightweight yet powerful communication platform:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript.
- **Build System**: Vite.
- **Communication**: WebRTC for direct audio/video streams
- **Signaling**: Firebase Firestore for efficient connection establishment
- **Deployment**: Static files that can be hosted anywhere


## Installation 

Setting up your own LibreCall instance takes just a few minutes:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kazisean/Libre-call.git
   cd Libre-call
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Firestore database in your project
   - Set up the following data model:
     - `calls` collection to store offer/answer objects
     - Each call document contains `answerCandidates` and `offerCandidates` subcollections


4. **Configure environment**
   - Create a `.env` file with your Firebase credentials & your own stun server link:
   ```
   VITE_API_KEY=
   VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
   VITE_PROJECT_ID=
   VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
   VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
   VITE_APP_ID=
   VITE_MEASUREMENT_ID=
   VITE_STUN_SERVER_1 = 
   VITE_STUN_SERVER_2 = 
   ```

5. **Build and deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - Deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to any static hosting provider

To start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
